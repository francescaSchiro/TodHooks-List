## Used Hooks to manage state of a simple Todo App. 
**(useReducer, useState, useContext.)** <br>
I followed [this](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext/) tutorial and (made few changes on the way)

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To run this project: 
Clone it first:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/francescaSchiro/TodHooks-List.git
```

In the project directory, you can run:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

*sorry for the design, it wasn't the main goal of the project. I'll try to make it nicer after.*

**If you want to know more about Hooks, see [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)**

### Understanding this example you will have learned:
_'how modern state management is used in React with **useState**, **useReducer** and **useContext**. Whereas useState is used for simple state (e.g. input field), useReducer is a greater asset for complex objects and complicated state transitions. In larger applications, useContext can be used to pass down dispatch functions (or state) from the useReducer hook.'_
